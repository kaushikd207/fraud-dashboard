A responsive and interactive Fraud Detection Dashboard built with **React**, **Chart.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The dashboard provides real-time insights into fraudulent applications and URLs, as well as a trend analysis of fraud cases over the past 30 days. Users can take actions such as **reporting**, **blocking**, or **investigating** fraudulent entities.

## Features

- **30-Day Trend Analysis**: Interactive line and bar charts showcasing fraud detection trends over the past 30 days.
- **Actionable Insights**: Options to report, block, or investigate fraudulent apps and URLs.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS, optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality (mocked for this demo) to access the dashboard.

## Tech Stack
